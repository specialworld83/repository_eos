<h2 id="Kernel_lockdown_mode">1.1. Kernel lockdown mode</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><p class="line874">This release introduces an optional kernel lockdown feature, intended to strengthen the boundary between UID 0 (root) and the kernel. When enabled, various pieces of kernel functionality are restricted. Applications that rely on low-level access to either hardware or the kernel may cease working as a result - therefore this should not be enabled without appropriate evaluation beforehand. The original purpose of this feature was to honour the anti-tampering protections expected in a secure-boot environment, but it is not tied to that. The majority of mainstream distributions have been carrying variants of this patchset for many years now. <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><p class="line874">Kernel lockdown is implemented as a Linux Security Module that can be configured in integrity or lockdown mode. If set to integrity, kernel features that allow userland to modify the running kernel are disabled. If set to confidentiality, kernel features that allow userland to extract confidential information from the kernel are also disabled. Configuration can be done at runtime (through securityfs), boot time (via a kernel parameter) or build time (via a kconfig option).  <span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span><p class="line862">Recommended LWN article: <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/791863/">Lockdown as a security module</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="virtio-fs.2C_a_bridge_to_share_file_systems_with_virtualized_guests">1.2. virtio-fs, a bridge to share file systems with virtualized guests</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><p class="line862">This release includes virtio-fs, a FUSE-based virtio driver for guest &lt;-&gt; host file system sharing. It allows a guest to mount a directory that has been exported on the host. Although there are existing technologies that allow this kind of functionality (NFS, virtio-9P), virtio-fs takes advantage of the proximity of VMs to achieve API semantics and performance more like local file systems. This is desirable both for performance and for application compatibility. <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><p class="line862">For more details, see the <a class="https" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/virtiofs.html">documentation</a>, the <a class="https" href="https://virtio-fs.gitlab.io/design.html">design documentation</a> and the <a class="https" href="https://virtio-fs.gitlab.io/">official web site</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="fs-verity.2C_for_detecting_file_modifications">1.3. fs-verity, for detecting file modifications</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><p class="line874">fs-verity is a support layer that filesystems can use to support transparent integrity and authenticity protection of read-only files. It is similar to dm-verity but works on files rather than block devices. Currently, it is supported by the ext4 and f2fs filesystems.  <span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><p class="line874">On regular files on filesystems supporting fs-verity, userspace can execute an ioctl that causes the filesystem to build a Merkle tree for the file and persist it to a filesystem-specific location associated with the file. Optionally, it is possible sign files with a key loaded into a keyring. After this, the file is made readonly, and all reads from the file are automatically verified against the file's Merkle tree. Reads of any corrupted data, including mmap reads, will fail. Userspace can efficently retrieve the root hash (&quot;file measurement&quot;) with another ioctl, which can be used for a variety of security applications.  <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><p class="line862">For more details, read the <a class="https" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fsverity.html">documentation</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><p class="line862">Recommended LWN article: <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/790185/">Yet another try for fs-verity</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="dm-clone">1.4. dm-clone</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span><p class="line874">dm-clone is a device mapper target which produces a one-to-one copy of an existing, read-only source device into a writable destination device: It presents a virtual block device which makes all data appear immediately, and redirects reads and writes accordingly. The main use case of dm-clone is to clone a potentially remote, high-latency, read-only, archival-type block device into a writable, fast, primary-type device for fast, low-latency I/O. The cloned device is visible/mountable immediately and the copy of the source device to the destination device happens in the background, in parallel with user I/O. <span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span><p class="line862">For more details, see the <a class="https" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-clone.html">documentation</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Support_for_new_AMD.2FIntel_graphics">1.5. Support for new AMD/Intel graphics</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span><p class="line874">This release adds support in the amdgpu driver for four new amdgpu products: Navi 12/14, Arcturus and Renoir APU support. <span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span><p class="line874">It also includes the first pieces for supporting the future Intel Tiger Lake GPU. <span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Two_new_madvise.28.29_flags:_MADV_COLD_and_MADV_PAGEOUT">1.6. Two new madvise() flags: MADV_COLD and MADV_PAGEOUT</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span><p class="line862">In order to improve memory usage in some systems (notably, Android), two new <tt>madvise()</tt> flags have been added: <tt>MADV_COLD</tt> and <tt>MADV_PAGEOUT</tt>. These new options complement <tt>MADV_DONTNEED</tt> and <tt>MADV_FREE</tt> by adding non-destructive ways to gain some free memory space. <span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span><p class="line867"><tt>MADV_COLD</tt> hints the kernel that the pages can be reclaimed when memory pressure happens but data should be preserved for future use, this can reduce <span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span>workingset eviction so it ends up increasing performance. In contrast to <tt>MADV_FREE</tt>, the contents of the region are preserved regardless of subsequent writes to pages. <tt>MADV_PAGEOUT</tt> can be used by a process to mark a memory range as not expected to be used for a long time so that kernel reclaims *any LRU* <span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span>pages instantly. The hint can help kernel in deciding which pages to evict proactively. Access in the range after successful operation could cause major page fault but never lose the up-to-date contents unlike <tt>MADV_DONTNEED</tt> <span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="EROFS_and_exFAT">1.7. EROFS and exFAT</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span><p class="line862">This release moves the EROFS file system out of the staging area. First included <a class="https" href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_4.19#New_experimental_EROFS_file_system">in Linux 4.19</a>, EROFS is a lightweight read-only file system with a modern design aimed for scenarios which need high-performance read-only requirements, e.g. firmware in mobile phone or Livecds.

<h2 id="More_efficient_polling_in_virtualized_guests_with_haltpoll">1.8. More efficient polling in virtualized guests with haltpoll</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-62"></span><p class="line862">This release includes a haltpoll cpuidle driver and a new matching governor. These two pieces allows guest vcpus to poll for a specified amount of time before halting, which provides the following benefits to host side polling: 1) The POLL flag is set while polling is performed, which allows a remote vCPU to avoid sending an IPI (and the associated cost of handling the IPI) when performing a wakeup. 2) The VM-exit cost can be avoided. The downside of guest side polling is that polling is performed even with other runnable tasks in the host. For more details see the <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/Documentation/virtual/guest-halt-polling.txt?id=2cffe9f6b96fece065ee8522673c90e92ef2085d">documentation</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-63"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="More_accurate_cgroup_I.2FO_control_with_blk-iocost">1.9. More accurate cgroup I/O control with blk-iocost</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-65"></span><p class="line862">One challenge of controlling I/O resources is the lack of reliability of trivial cost metrics. Bandwidth and iops can be off by orders of magnitude depending on the device type and I/O pattern. This is challenging for the I/O cgroup controllers: while <tt>io.latency</tt> provides the capability to comprehensively prioritize and protect IOs depending on the cgroups, its protection is binary - the lowest latency target cgroup is protected at the cost of all others.  <span class="anchor" id="line-66"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span><p class="line862">This release introduces blk-iocost, an I/O cost model based work-conserving proportional controller. It currently has a simple linear cost model builtin where each I/O is classified as sequential or random and given a base cost accordingly and additional size-proportional cost is added on top. Each I/O is given a fairly reliable cost,  and distributes I/O capacity for each cgroup according to their hierarchical weight. For more details, see the cgroup documentation for <a class="https" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#io">io.cost.qos and io.cost.model</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span><p class="line862">Recommended LWN article: <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/792256/">The io.weight I/O-bandwidth controller</a> (the io.weight name is no longer used) <span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-71"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Kernel_symbol_namespacing">1.10. Kernel symbol namespacing</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-72"></span><p class="line874">In order to support modules, the kernel needs to export the symbols of functions needed by modules. With more than 30k of those symbols existing in the current kernel, managing the symbols is sometimes messy. This feature allows allows subsystem maintainers to partition and categorize their exported symbols into explicit namespaces, which makes easier to control the use of symbols. Module authors are now required to import the namespaces they need. <span class="anchor" id="line-73"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-74"></span><p class="line862">For more details, read <a class="https" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/symbol-namespaces.html">the documentation</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-75"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-76"></span><p class="line862">Recommended LWN article: <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/760045/">Kernel symbol namespacing</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-77"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-78"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-79"></span><p class="line867">

Now all memcg caches will be shrunk when writing to the &quot;global&quot; shrink file. <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/04f768a39d55967246c002aa66b407b3bfdd8269">commit</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-178"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Throttle allocators when reclaim cannot keep up with v2 memory.high limit <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/0e4b01df865935007bd712cbc8e7299005b28894">commit</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-179"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Introduce gradual reclaim pressure between v2 <tt>memory.low</tt> and <tt>memory.min</tt> thresholds instead of the previous cliff behaviour. <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9783aa9917f8ae24759e67bf882f1aba32fe4ea1">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/9de7ca46ad2688bd51e80f7119fefa301ad7f3fa">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/1bc63fb1272be0773e925f78c0fbd06c89701d55">commit</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-180"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Improve situation with multiple parallel reclaimers by letting each walk through the whole cgroup tree, resulting in fewer premature OOM kills. <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/1ba6fc9af35bf97c84567d9b3eeb26629d1e3af0">commit</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-181"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Deprecate v1 <tt>kmem.limit_in_bytes</tt> due to causing unexpected <tt>ENOMEM</tt> failures and global OOM's. <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/0158115f702b0ba208ab0b5adf44cae99b3ebcc7">commit</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-182"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Prevent premature OOM's due to deferred Transparent Huge Page split queue. <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/364c1eebe453f06f0c1e837eb155a5725c9cd272">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/7ae88534cdd96235cd775c03b32a75009355740b">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/0a432dcbeb32edcd211a5d8f7847d0da7642a8b4">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/87eaceb3faa59b9b4d940ec9554ce251325d83fe">commit</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-183"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Implement foreign inode flushing to avoid pathological cases when two different cgroups are writing to the same inode <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/5b9cce4c7eb0696558dfd4946074ae1fb9d8f05d">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/34f8fe501f0624de115d087680c84000b5d9abc9">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/ed288dc0d4aa29f65bd25b31b5cb866aa5664ff9">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/d62241c7a406f0680d702bd974f6f17e28ab8e5d">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/97b27821b4854ca744946dae32a3f2fd55bcd5bc">commit</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-184"></span></li></ul></li><li><p class="line862">Experimentally enable Transparent Huge Page support for text section (executable code) of non-shmem files (<tt>CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS</tt>) <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/585e5a7babd91fd85a5cc97b7324c6c2fc29e1ec">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/31895438e702f48e25b7aa6d88f9c97c795c79c7">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/520e5ba415906373186bcd3c7cffa3535bfdbdde">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/60fbf0ab5da1c360e02b7f7d882bf1c0d8f7e32a">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/579c571e2efdb8e5b50959ae66b6142e05bd704f">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/99cb0dbd47a15d395bf3faa78dc122bc5efe3fc0">commit</a>, <a class="https" href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/09d91cda0e8207c1f14ee0d572f61a53dbcdaf85">commit</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-185"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Change the handling of Transparent Huge Page faults so that they are tried first on a local NUMA node with no memory reclaim allowed, and if they not succeed, for madvise(<tt>MADV_HUGEPAGE</tt>) areas retry on all nodes, allowing reclaim.
