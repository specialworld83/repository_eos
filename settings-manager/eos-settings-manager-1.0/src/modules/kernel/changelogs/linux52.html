<h2 id="Inclusion_of_Sound_Open_Firmware">1.1. Inclusion of Sound Open Firmware</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><p class="line862">While many audio DSP devices have open source drivers, their firmware has remained closed and shipped as binary files. As a result, firmware issues have often been difficult to address. The Sound Open Firmware -SOF- project, backed by Intel and Google, has been created to improve this situation by providing a open source platform to create open source firmware for audio DSPs. Not only SOF will allow users to have open source firmware, it will allow them to personalize their own firmware, or even use the power of the DSP processors in their sound cards in imaginative ways. This release includes the SOF core, plus open source firmware from Intel for many of their mainstream products: Baytrail, CherryTrail, Broadwell, ApolloLake, GeminiLake, CannonLake and IceLake  <span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><p class="line862">Recommended LWN article: <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/749888/">The Sound Open Firmware project launches</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span><p class="line862">Project site: <a class="https" href="https://www.sofproject.org">https://www.sofproject.org</a>  <span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><p class="line862">Instructions in the ALSA website: <a class="https" href="https://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Firmware">https://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Firmware</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Improved_Presure_Stall_Information_for_better_resource_monitoring">1.2. Improved Presure Stall Information for better resource monitoring</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><p class="line862">Pressure stall information were <a class="https" href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_4.20#Pressure_stall_information_for_better_overview_of_system_load">added to Linux 4.20</a> as a way to quantify resource pressure in the system in a better way than the traditional load average. PSI aggregates and reports the overall wallclock time in which the tasks in a system (or cgroup) wait for cpu, io or memory.  <span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span><p class="line874">This release lets users to configure sensitive thresholds and use poll() and friends to be notified when a certain pressure thresold is breached within a user-defined time window. With this mechanism, Android can monitor for, and ward off, mounting memory shortages before they cause problems for the user. For example, using memory stall, monitors in userspace like the low memory killer daemon (lmkd) can detect mounting pressure and kill less important processes before device becomes visibly sluggish.  In memory stress testing psi memory monitors produce roughly 10x less false positives compared to vmpressure. <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><p class="line862">Recommended LWN article: <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/775971/">Pressure stall monitors</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="New_mount_API">1.3. New mount API</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><p class="line862">The mount(2) system call is in charge of mounting file systems. It does its job well, but as new mount functionality was added over the years, it had to be implemented on top of the existing interface, which was not designed for complex scenarios and has thus accumulated a lot of baggage (see <a class="https" href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/10610615/">this email</a> for details). The current mount(2) interface is actually six or seven different interfaces rolled into one, and weird combinations of flags make it do different things beyond the original specification of the system call. It's not just aesthethics; it's not easy for applications and users to understand the errors returned, it is not geared for the specification of multiple sources such as overlayfs need, you can't mount a file system into another mount namespace, and it doesn't allow for other funcionality that have to be implemented with hacks such as <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/687354/">shiftfs</a>. <span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><p class="line874">Linux developers decided to redesign the entire mount API in this release, which has resulted in the addition of six new syscalls: fsopen(2), fsconfig(2), fsmount(2), move_mount(2), fspick(2), and open_tree(2). These syscalls allow developers write code such as this: <span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><pre><span class="anchor" id="line-1"></span>        fd = fsopen(&quot;nfs&quot;);

<h2 id="Significant_performance_improvements_in_the_BFQ_I.2FO_scheduler">1.4. Significant performance improvements in the BFQ I/O scheduler</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span><p class="line862">Some performance tweaks to the BFQ I/O scheduler have been done, which have improved the application start-up times under load by up to 80%, drastically increased the performance and decreased the execution time. For more details, see the <a class="https" href="https://algo.ing.unimo.it/people/paolo/disk_sched/results.php">benchmarks</a> or the following article: <span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span><p class="line862">Recommended LWN article: <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/784267/">Improving the performance of the BFQ I/O scheduler</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="New_GPU_drivers_for_ARM_Mali_devices">1.5. New GPU drivers for ARM Mali devices</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span><p class="line874">This release has two exciting community drivers for ARM Mali accelerators. Since ARM has never been open source friendly on the GPU side of the house, the community has had to create open source drivers for the Mali GPUs. Lima covers the older t4xx and panfrost the newer 6xx/7xx series. Well done to all involved and hopefully this will help ARM <span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-60"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-61"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="More_CPU_bug_protection.2C_and_.22mitigations.22_boot_option">1.6. More CPU bug protection, and &quot;mitigations&quot; boot option</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-62"></span><p class="line862">This release adds bug infrastructure to deal with the Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) hardware vulnerability, which allows unprivileged speculative access to data which is available in various CPU internal buffers. This new set of misfeatures has the following variants: Microarchitectural Store Buffer Data Sampling (MSBDS, CVE-2018-12126), Microarchitectural Fill Buffer Data Sampling (MFBDS, CVE-2018-12130), Microarchitectural Load Port Data Sampling (MLPDS, CVE-2018-12127), Microarchitectural Data Sampling Uncacheable Memory (MDSUM, CVE-2019-11091). For more details see the <a class="https" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/x86/mds.html">documentation</a> and <a class="https" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/mds.html">admin guide</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-63"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span><p class="line862">Also, in order to help users to deal with the ever increasing amount of CPU bugs across different architectures, the kernel boot option <tt>mitigations=</tt> has been added. It's a set of curated, arch-independent options (for now x86, PowerPC and s390), to make more easy to enable/disable protections regardless of what system they are running <span class="anchor" id="line-65"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-66"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Let_clone.282.29_return_pidfs">1.7. Let clone(2) return pidfs</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span><p class="line862">This release adds the <tt>CLONE_PIDFD</tt> flag to clone(2). This lets users to get pids at process creation time that are usable with the <a class="https" href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_5.1#Safe_signal_delivery_in_presence_of_PID_reuse">pidfd_send_signal(2)</a> syscall. Due to the design of Unix, sending signals to processes or gathering /proc information <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/784831/">is not always safe</a> due to the possibility of PID reuse; pidfds let Linux avoid this problem, and this new clone(2) flag makes even easier to get pidfs, thus providing an easy way to signal and process PID metadata safely. <span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Optional_support_for_case-insensitive_names_in_ext4">1.8. Optional support for case-insensitive names in ext4</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-71"></span><p class="line862">This release implements the actual support for case-insensitive file name lookups in ext4, based on the feature bit and the encoding stored in the superblock. A filesystem that has the casefold feature set is able to configure directories with <tt>chattr&nbsp;+F</tt> (<tt>EXT4_CASEFOLD_FL</tt>) attribute, enabling lookups to succeed in that directory in a case-insensitive fashion, i.e: match a directory entry even if the name used by userspace is not a byte per byte match with the disk name, but is an equivalent case-insensitive version of the Unicode string. <span class="anchor" id="line-72"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-73"></span><p class="line874">The feature is configured as an inode attribute applied to directories and inherited by its children. This attribute can only be enabled on empty directories for filesystems that support the encoding feature, thus preventing collision of file names that only differ by case. <span class="anchor" id="line-74"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-75"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-76"></span><p class="line862">Recommended LWN article: <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/784041/">Case-insensitive ext4</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-77"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-78"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-79"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Add_freezer_controller_for_cgroups_v2">1.9. Add freezer controller for cgroups v2</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-80"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-81"></span><p class="line862">Cgroup v1 implements the freezer controller, which provides an ability to stop the workload in a cgroup and temporarily free up some resources (cpu, io, network bandwidth and, potentially, memory) for some other tasks. <a class="https" href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_4.5#cgroup_unified_hierarchy_is_considered_stable">Cgroup v2</a> lacked this functionality, until this release. <span class="anchor" id="line-82"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-83"></span><p class="line874">Unlike with the cgroup v1 version, there is no separate controller, which has to be turned on, the functionality is always available and is represented by cgroup.freeze and cgroup.events cgroup control files. Writing &quot;1&quot; to the cgroup.freeze file will cause freezing of the cgroup and all descendant cgroups and all their belonging processes will be stopped and will not run until the cgroup will be explicitly unfrozen. Freezing may take some time; when this action is completed, the &quot;frozen&quot; value in the cgroup.events control file will be updated to &quot;1&quot;. There are other differences required to conform the cgroup v2 interface design principles. <span class="anchor" id="line-84"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-85"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-86"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Add_device_mapper_dust_target">1.10. Add device mapper dust target</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-87"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span><p class="line874">This release adds a Device Mapper 'dust' target. This target simulates a device that has failing sectors and/or read failures, and adds the ability to enable the emulation of the read failures at an arbitrary time. It is, thus, aimed at storage developers and sysadmins that want to test their storage stack. At a given time, the user can send a message to the target to start failing read requests on specific blocks.  When the failure behavior is enabled, reads of blocks configured &quot;bad&quot; will fail with EIO.  <span class="anchor" id="line-89"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-90"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-91"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-92"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-93"></span><p class="line867">
